Sparse.java takes an input file and an output file and builds two matrices, A and B, according to the specifications in the input file. Using Matrix methods, it prints several computations using the two matrices.

Matrix.java is a Matrix ADT that will be used in Sparse

List.java is an Object List ADT that will be used to hold the Entries for the Matrix

MatrixTest.java tests the methods of Matrix in isolation

ListTest.java tests the methods of List in isolation

Makefile creates executable jar file Sparse
